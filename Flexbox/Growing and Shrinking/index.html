    <div>
      <h2>The Flex Shorthand</h2>
      <p>"flex" is a property that you can give to elements.</p>
      <p>flex: 0 is shorthand for:</p>
      <p>Equivalently, we might say "flex 1 1 0"</p>
      <ul>
        <li>flex-grow: 1</li>
        <li>flex-shrink: 1</li>
        <li>flex-basis: 0</li>
      </ul>
      <p>flex: auto is shorthand for:</p>
      <p>Equivalently, we might say flex 1 1 auto</p>
      <ul>
        <li>flex-grow: 1</li>
        <li>flex-shrink: 1</li>
        <li>flex-basis: auto</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Flex-Grow</h2>
      <p>Flex-Grow expects a single number as its value.</p>
      <p>This is the <em>growth factor</em>.</p>
      <p>flex: 1 means that each element is going to grow the same amount</p>
      <p>
        flex: 2 would tell an element to grow <strong>twice</strong> the size of
        the other flex elements in the flexbox.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Flex-Shrink</h2>
      <p>
        Flex-Shrink is the same idea of Flex-Grow, but sets the shrink factor
        instead
      </p>
      <p>
        Flex-Shrink only works if the side of the parent flex container is
        smaller than the width of the combined flex elements.
      </p>
      <p>If we don't want an element to shrink, we say flex: 0.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Flex-Basis</h2>
      <p>Flex-Basis sets the initial size of a flex item</p>
      <p>Any growing or shrinking starts from that base value</p>
      <p>
        flex-basis: auto is a common way to fill it out if we want to respect
        defined width values
      </p>
