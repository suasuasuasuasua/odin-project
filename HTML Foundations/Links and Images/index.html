      <!-- Entire section about links -->
      <h2>Anchors and Links</h2>
      <div>
        <!-- Dead links -->
        <p>
          Anchors are 'links' essentially. They are created using the 'a' tag
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <a>Dead link</a>
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- Absolute links -->
      <div>
        <p>
          Absolute links: protocol://domain/path These are links to pages on the
          internet
        </p>
        <p>
          Anchors need to know where to go, and the destination is defined using
          an attribute tag
        </p>
        <p>
          This particular href (hyperlink reference) leads to the Odin page; it
          is an external link
        </p>
        <p>
          Now there is a blue outline for the link, signifying that it is an
          active link
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">Click me</a>
        </p>
      </div>
      <!-- Relative links -->
      <div>
        <p>
          Relative links: depends on the current file or domain name. These are
          links that are relative to the current file on the file structure
        </p>
        <p>
          If we wanted to link to an about page, we might do the following This
          only works because index.html and about.html are in the same directory
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <a href="about.html">About (broken)</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that about.html has been moved into the pages/ directory, we have
          to be more specific in the href
        </p>
        <p>
          It is good practice to prepend ./ to specify that 'from the current
          directory' move to pages/ then look for about.html
        </p>
        <p align="center">
          <a href="./pages/about.html">About</a>
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Images</h2>
      <p>
        Images can be referenced using the im> tag The img element is unique, in
        that it is empty, so it does not need a closing tag
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is an example using an absolute link from the Odin Project.
        <img
          src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png"
          alt="The Odin Project Logo"
        />
      </p>

      <p>Here is an exapmle using a relative link from the file structure.</p>
      <p>
        <img src="images/dog.jpg" alt="A cute black pug" />
      </p>
    </div>
