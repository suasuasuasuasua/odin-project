    <p>This is the first paragraph</p>
    <p>This is the second paragraph</p>

    <!-- Headings are bigger than normal text -->

    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading 6</h6>

    <!-- Certain emphasis can be put on elements with special tags -->

    <p>This is a <strong>strong</strong> word.</p>
    <p>This is an <em>italicized</em> word.</p>

    <!-- When elements are used in conjunction, this is called nesting -->
    <!-- A parent child relation is created, where the parent is the outermost tag, siblings are at the same level of nesting, children are innermost -->
    <!-- Parents can have many children, and children can only have one parent, which may have many parents -->

    <!-- It is important to use indentation to denote the relationships between elements and to make the code readable -->
